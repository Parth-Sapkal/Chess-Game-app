## 🔎 How It Works

- `engine.py` handles the **chess logic** (legal moves, turns, check/checkmate)
- `board.py` is the **main file** that runs the game interface and user interactions
- Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** for better code organization
- Images of chess pieces are dynamically loaded and rendered using Pygame
- Move inputs are processed via mouse clicks on a grid-based board
